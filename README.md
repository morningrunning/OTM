iOS Project Application for Udacity Nanodegree Program
OnTheMap

OnTheMap is the third app from Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. It's the capstone app for the course on iOS Networking with Swift: Web Services, APIs, and JSON.

The app lets Nanodegree students share their locations and see other shared locations plotted on a map or presented in a table view. It uses Udacity's API for user authentication and the Parse API to store and retrieve student location data.
